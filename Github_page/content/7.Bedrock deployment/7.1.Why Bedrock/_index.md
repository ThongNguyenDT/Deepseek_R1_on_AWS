### 🏗️ **Deploying DeepSeek on AWS Bedrock**

#### 1️⃣ **Setting Up the Environment**

First, configure your AWS account and enable the Bedrock service. Then, use **AWS SDK (boto3)** to connect to the Bedrock API.

```python
import boto3

# Initialize AWS Bedrock client
bedrock_client = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")
```

#### 2️⃣ **Calling the DeepSeek Model via API**

AWS Bedrock allows you to select an LLM from the available models and send prompts to receive responses.

```python
prompt = "Write an introduction about AWS Bedrock and DeepSeek."

response = bedrock_client.invoke_model(
    modelId="deepseek-llm-xxl",
    contentType="application/json",
    body={"prompt": prompt, "max_tokens": 500}
)

print(response["body"].read().decode())
```

#### 3️⃣ **Integrating with Real-world Applications**

You can deploy the API using **AWS Lambda** or integrate it with **Amazon S3** and **DynamoDB** to build chatbots, data analysis tools, or automated content systems.
