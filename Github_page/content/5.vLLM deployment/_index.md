### 1. Introduction  

In this guide, we’ll explore the most cost-effective way to deploy a large language model (LLM) from a local environment to a server.  

One of the biggest challenges in this process is designing a robust application that can handle multiple concurrent requests on limited hardware while maintaining high performance.  

To tackle this, we’ll dive into **vLLM**, a powerful solution for optimizing inference efficiency.  

### 2. Key Topics  

This guide is structured around two main topics:  

1. **Understanding vLLM** – How vLLM works, its benefits, and real-world applications in optimizing LLM inference.  
2. **Deploying DeepSeek R1 Distill on vLLM** – A step-by-step guide on implementing a distilled model with vLLM to achieve high efficiency at low cost.  

Let’s get started and see how vLLM can supercharge LLM inference!
